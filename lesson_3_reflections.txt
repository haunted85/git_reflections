When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Having a remote repository has the following pros:
        + remote code serves as backup copy in case of disaster;
        + it makes easier working on multiple machines;
        + allows sharing among users.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If I am modifying some file and the pull occurrs automatically with an older
    version of the file, the action might override my changes and my work could be lost.
